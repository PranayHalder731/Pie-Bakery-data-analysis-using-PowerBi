# Pie-Bakery-data-analysis-using-PowerBi
🚀 Excited to Share My Recent Power BI Project! 🚀
In the Bakery industry, optimizing operations and understanding revenue trends are key factors for business growth. I recently worked on a project that tackled this challenge using Power BI to gain deep insights into sales and operational data. 🍞🥧
Problem Statement:
The task was to help a bakery business make data-driven decisions by analyzing sales performance based on:
Order Types (Pre-orders/In-store)
Organic Status (Organic/Non-organic products)
Pie Flavors and Pie Types
Key Objectives:
📅 Calendar Table Creation: Developed a dynamic DAX-based calendar table to manage different date granularity such as year, quarter, month, and week.
📈 Revenue Trend Analysis: Created and implemented multiple DAX measures to compute Cumulative Revenue, Average Revenue, and other KPIs.
📊 Data Visualizations:
Stacked area chart showcasing Cumulative Revenue over Time.
Column charts depicting Total Revenue by Quarter.
Ribbon charts displaying Total Revenue by Weekday for better sales understanding.
🔄 Dynamic Filtering: Implemented slicers for order types (Pre-order/In-store) for flexible, on-the-fly data filtering and analysis.
💼 KPIs: Designed KPIs like Total Transactions, Total Orders, Total Revenue, and Last Transaction Date to track business performance.
Tools & Techniques Used:
Power BI for interactive visualizations and dashboard creation.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is used to calculate complex business metrics.
Data Modeling for connecting different datasets efficiently.
Impact:
This Power BI dashboard provides actionable insights, allowing bakery owners to:
Better understanding of seasonal demand and popular pie flavors.
Optimize inventory and staffing based on order types and revenue trends.
Track the impact of organic vs. non-organic products on overall sales.
